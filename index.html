            <h2 class="mb-5">About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Pavla Smiljanić Stanojević, a teacher and a HR manager. I hold a Master's degree in Serbian
                Literature and Language from the Faculty of Philosophy in Novi Sad, Serbia. During my student days I
                learned about the theory of literature, medieval and national literature, Serbian folklore and myth. I
                also learned about the theory of philosophy, and methodology. I studied South Slavic languages with
                Serbian grammar and standard vocabulary being the main focus of this.. My Master's studies were based on
                research and writing my dissertation. As part of this degree I learned a little more about feminism,
                human rights, nonviolent behavior, self-improvement and I also completed a placement at a school working
                with young people and the colleagues in my class. Ever since I was a child I have enjoyed working with
                people, and being able to build relationships with them. I have also been key in motivating those around
                me to have more courage, strive for something better and I have also helped them to become better
                versions of themselves by encouraging them to do the right thing and achieve their goals</p>

            <p>In April 2016, I had the privilege of joining one of the greatest organizations of NASA Hackathon in
                Belgrade. I volunteered there briefly and was inspired to join together all my knowledge, interests,
                passions and ideas nto one. I realized that my dream job is Human Resource manager. I finished my
                postgraduate studies at the Business Academy in Belgrade, and in doing so I learned more about this this
                field.. In 2018 I completed many courses.. I developed my understanding of communication, assertive
                communication, body language, business etiquette business documentation, human development, training and
                behavior. Of all this my biggest accomplishment was an 8 day PDP Seminar on personal development, where
                I received a recommendation from my mentor.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, I gained valuable experience at the Link2job job fair this year when I volunteered at the
                help desk with team organization, technical support and so on and so forth. In this role I was a vital
                team member and worked with different representatives of various companies in a positive environment. My
                passions lie in education, building long lasting relationships and achieving goals. I am an empathic
                person with a high level of social intelligence. I pride myself in being creative and also having a good
                deal of common sense. As a curious person, I love learning, researching new ideas, cooking and reading
                books, particularly those regarding philosophy I like being part of something new - seeing a project
                develop from infancy and feeling a sense of fulfillment as it progresses. One of my own favorite sayings
                is: ‘I like the beauty of life’s game, writing when you have only an empty page, a person’s development
                step by step.‘ I like to bring a lease of new life to projects, people and situations. My strengths are
                soft skills like social intelligence, emotional intelligence, empathy, passion for development, eye for
                detail, creative energy, and a positive and friendly attitude. I strive to develop my talent and achieve
                career and personal goals. I believe in harmony, I think when you have a dream a good plan, method and
                strategy nothing is impossible.</p>
